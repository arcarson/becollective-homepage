            While we are now more digitally connected than ever, we are not nearly as engaged.
            <br />
            Something has to change.
            <br />
            So we created Be Collective - It&apos;s social infrastructure designed to eliminate
            duplication, misdirection and waste of effort, promoting a culture of kindness,
            recognition and support.
